# Bosch Future Mobility Challenge (BFMC) — Team Autonomists

This repository contains the software architecture, embedded firmware, and mechanical designs developed by Team Autonomists for the Bosch Future Mobility Challenge. The project focuses on the development of a 1:10 scale autonomous vehicle capable of real-time perception, localized decision-making, and V2X communication.

## Technical Architecture

The system utilizes a distributed computing model, split between a high-level processing unit (Raspberry Pi/PC) and a low-level microcontroller (STM32 Nucleo).

### 1. Perception Module
* **Lane Detection (LD):** Computer vision algorithms for track boundary identification and ego-lane positioning.
* **Object Identification:** Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for real-time classification of traffic signs, obstacles, and pedestrian markers.

### 2. Control Module
* **State Machine:** High-level logic for intersection handling and traffic rule compliance.
* **Kinematic Modeling:** Calculation of required steering angles and longitudinal velocity.
* **Signal Processing:** PID control loops for stabilizing motor output and servo positioning.

### 3. Connectivity Module
* **V2X Communication:** Integration with the Bosch Environmental Server via MQTT/TCP-IP protocols.
* **Localization:** Processing of global positioning data and traffic light status provided by the server infrastructure.

### 4. Embedded Platform (Firmware)
* **Actuation:** Low-level PWM generation for the BLDC motor and steering servo.
* **Sensor Feedback:** High-frequency interrupt handling for rotary encoders and IMU data acquisition.
